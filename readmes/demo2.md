Great choice! An Event Booking System with Kafka is a solid demo project to showcase real-time data handling, asynchronous processing, and microservice communication. Here‚Äôs a development plan and set of requirements to guide your implementation.

---

### ‚úÖ **Project Overview**

Build a web-based Event Booking System for concerts and movies where users can:

* Browse upcoming events.
* View available seats in real-time.
* Book seats (with mocked payment).
* Get booking confirmation.
* (Optionally) Admins can add events.

Kafka will be used to decouple and stream real-time data across services like booking, inventory, and notifications.

### üîß **Architecture**

Microservices-based architecture (or modular monolith for simplicity):

1. **API Gateway / Web App** ‚Äì Frontend interface (React or Thymeleaf).
2. **User Service** ‚Äì Handles registration, login, user profiles.
3. **Event Service** ‚Äì Manages event data (CRUD), seat layouts.
4. **Booking Service** ‚Äì Handles seat booking logic.
5. **Payment Service (mock)** ‚Äì Always returns success/failure.
6. **Notification Service** ‚Äì Sends booking confirmation (email/simulated).
7. **Kafka** ‚Äì Streams booking events, payment status, and notification triggers.

### üóÇÔ∏è **Requirements**

#### Functional

* **User Auth**: Register, login, JWT-based session.
* **Browse Events**: List and search by type, date, location.
* **View Details**: Event info, seating chart with available/held/booked status.
* **Book Seats**: Select seats, checkout, mock payment, confirmation.
* **Admin Panel (optional)**: Create/edit/delete events.
* **Real-Time Updates**: Kafka updates on booking to prevent overbooking.

#### Non-Functional

* Handle concurrent seat booking safely.
* Real-time seat availability (use Kafka for booking events).
* Use Kafka topics:

    * `booking.attempted`
    * `booking.confirmed`
    * `booking.failed`
    * `notifications.send`

### üß± **Development Plan**

#### Phase 1: Base Setup

* [ ] User Service with JWT-based login/register.
* [ ] Event Service with REST endpoints to list and manage events.
* [ ] Seed sample events and seats.

#### Phase 2: Booking Logic

* [ ] Implement Booking Service to:

    * Lock seats temporarily.
    * Send Kafka event on booking attempt.
* [ ] Kafka Consumer to listen and confirm booking.
* [ ] Mock Payment Service:

    * Accept booking ID.
    * Randomly approve/reject.
    * Produce Kafka event on status.

#### Phase 3: Notifications

* [ ] Listen to `booking.confirmed` events.
* [ ] Simulate email/success message to user.

#### Phase 4: Real-Time Seat Management (optional/advanced)

* [ ] WebSockets or SSE to push seat availability.
* [ ] Use Kafka to notify UI/backend of seat status changes.

### üí°Tech Stack Suggestions

* **Backend**: Java + Spring Boot (REST, Kafka)
* **Database**: PostgreSQL or MySQL
* **Messaging**: Apache Kafka
* **Frontend**: React or HTML/Thymeleaf (optional)
* **Testing**: JUnit, Testcontainers
* **DevOps**: Docker Compose (Kafka + DB), optional Kubernetes
