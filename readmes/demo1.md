A **ticketing system** is a solid directionâ€”but to showcase **real-time data processing with Kafka**, it should include **events** that make sense to process asynchronously or across services.

Here are a few **demo project ideas** that evolve naturally from a login/register base and highlight Kafkaâ€™s strengths:

---

### âœ… **1. Ticketing System with Real-Time Event Notifications**

#### Key Features:

* Users can **create support tickets**.
* Admins can **respond to tickets**, assign priority.
* Kafka streams:

    * When a ticket is created/updated, emit `TicketEvent` to Kafka.
    * Notify real-time dashboards or agents listening on Kafka.
    * Send email/SMS (simulated) notifications.

#### Kafka Topics:

* `ticket.created`
* `ticket.updated`
* `ticket.assigned`

#### Bonus:

Add a `ticket-status-stream` service that aggregates open/resolved tickets and broadcasts status updates via WebSocket or SSE.

### âœ… **2. E-commerce Order Processing System**

#### Key Features:

* Users register/login and **place orders**.
* Orders are published to Kafka.
* A separate **OrderProcessor** service:

    * Reads from Kafka.
    * Simulates payment, shipping, or fraud detection.
    * Writes to DB or sends further events.

#### Kafka Topics:

* `order.placed`
* `order.paid`
* `order.shipped`

---

### âœ… **3. Event Booking System (e.g., concerts/movies)**

#### Key Features:

* Users can browse events, book seats.
* Booking requests published to Kafka.
* Kafka consumer verifies availability, issues confirmation or failure.
* Booking analytics (number of seats sold per event) via Kafka Streams.

#### Kafka Topics:

* `event.booked`
* `event.cancelled`
* `event.analytics`

---

### âœ… **4. Real-Time User Activity Tracker**

#### Key Features:

* Logins, logouts, ticket views, edits are tracked.
* Send `UserActivityEvent` to Kafka.
* Backend Kafka consumer stores logs, updates live usage dashboard.

#### Kafka Topics:

* `user.activity`

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Recommendation (for Demo)

Go with a **ticketing system with Kafka-based event publishing** and a secondary **consumer service** (microservice or standalone) to:

* Track ticket changes.
* Process ticket analytics.
* Simulate notifications.

It balances business logic, real-time processing, and system design.
